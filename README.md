# Muddy-Splash-Potion
Minecraft fabric mod. Splash potions (with no status effects) convert dirt blocks into mud.

No client installation is required (fully server-side). 
I've also added a gamerule to turn the feature off, even though I assume that if you have installed the mod, you likely want to use it.
Feel free to give suggestions.
